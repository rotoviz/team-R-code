# Thanks to Kevin Cole for pointing out the googlesheets package and offering this bit of 
# code to pull in the Google sheet. This relies on dplyr for passing the objects through a 
# pipe (%>%) which we'll discuss more later. gs_read(ws = 2) says that we want the 2nd google 
# sheet. Note that you may be redirected to your browser to provide Google Authentication.

rbTbl <- gs_url("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MhmzWDgIqCIoYL0K1c8MG43W1djmSw5trl5-oJfe24Q/") %>% gs_read(ws = 2)

# Maybe the first thing we want to do is drop columns that we don't need. We can do that by 
# subsetting the data frame using its index properties. This line just redefines the data frame 
# as being only columns 2 through 18.

rbTbl <- rbTbl[,2:18]

# Now we have some numeric columns that need to be transformed in order to be able to run 
# any calculations on them. The height column uses the crazy combine format of FeetInchesEighths. 
# So let's pull that into its component parts using some regular expressions. Regex is a powerful 
# way to parse strings. We'll use the stringr package which you may need to install. Note that 
# you can always install a package in RStudio by using the packages tab in the lower right.

library(stringr)

# This line uses the str_extract function to pull one piece of string out of another. When 
# you're first learning how to use regular expressions it will be helpful to do these things 
# one step at a time. Later you'll be able to combine several lines of code into one. This 
# line says to extract the first occurrence {1} of the pattern [0-9] which essentially just 
# tells it to pull out the first number it finds in the string. We know that no player is double 
# digits in feet tall, so we just need to look for that first number in order to get the feet. 
# We're creating a new column to hold this value.

rbTbl$FEET <- str_extract(rbTbl$Height,"[0-9]{1}")

# The next thing we want to do is look for the numbers that are in the 2-3 positions in the 
# string, because those will be the inches of height. But that's easier to do if we delete the 
# feet number out of the height column first. Otherwise we'll have to do a more complex Regex 
# that tells it to look for the second occurence of something. So first we'll delete the feet 
# number from the string using the str_replace function and then just specifying that we're 
# going to replace it with nothing.

rbTbl$Height <- str_replace(rbTbl$Height,"[0-9]{1}","")

# Now we can use str_extract to pull out the inches digits since they're now first in the 
# sequence after we've deleted the feet. Don't worry, we're going to put this all back together 
# later. But this line of code says to find the first occurrence of two consecutive number characters and then create a new column called INCHES with those characters

rbTbl$INCHES <- str_extract(rbTbl$Height,"[0-9]{2}")

# IF you look at the data you can see that it's unlikely that the data is
# actually being recorded down to the eighth, which this format presupposes. More
# likely the data is being recorded down to the half inch. But we can still pull
# out the eighths by using a regular expression saying to find a single
# occurrence of a number character, but starting at the end of the string. The $
# operator in a regular expression says to start at the end of the string.

rbTbl$EIGHTHS <- str_extract(rbTbl$Height,"[0-9]{1}$")

# Now we have three columns where we've done some string extraction to parse out
# the combine's height measurement. But the data is still in string or character
# format. So we'll use the sapply function to iterate over the 18:20 columns and
# apply the as.numeric function.

rbTbl[18:20] <- sapply(rbTbl[18:20],as.numeric)

# Now we can calculate the players' heights in inches by referring to each column
# by the dataFrame$column convention.

rbTbl$Height <- rbTbl$FEET*12 + rbTbl$INCHES + rbTbl$EIGHTHS/8

# The weight column is in pretty good shape but we just need to make sure it's in
# number format since the functions that brought the data in are reliant on
# functions that default to character format. We can change to numeric with one
# line/function.

rbTbl$Weight <- as.numeric(rbTbl$Weight)

# This line just calculates the players' BMI. If we wanted to get rid of lots of
# decimal places we could wrap this function in a round()

rbTbl$BMI <- rbTbl$Weight*703/(rbTbl$Height^2)

# Both the arm length and the hand length can be parsed by pulling out the whole
# numbers, as well as the numerator and denominator of the fractions. This line
# extracts the first occurence of number characters until it runs into a
# non-numeric character. The + operator just tells it to keep going and not stop
# at any set number. That's because some hand lengths are single digits and some
# players have hands that are 10 inches.

rbTbl$WHOLE <- as.numeric(str_extract(rbTbl$Hand,"[0-9]+"))

# Now we can pull out the numerator of the fraction. In this case the pattern I'm
# telling it to look for is a space followed by a single numeric character. Then
# I wrap it in as.numeric to convert the string that it extracts into a number.

rbTbl$NUM <- as.numeric(str_extract(rbTbl$Hand," [0-9]"))

# To get the denominator we again use the $ operator to start at the end of the string.

rbTbl$DENOM <- as.numeric(str_extract(rbTbl$Hand,"[0-9]$"))

# Now it's time to start re-assembling those components back into a decimal
# version of hand size. First, you may note that some players don't have a
# fraction for their hand size because they're landing right on a whole number.
# In those cases the NUM column is NA. We can use that NA to tell R that in
# cases where NUM is NA, we want Hand to be equal to the WHOLE column. This line
# does that. It uses the brackets following the dataFrame$column method to tell
# R that we're only going to be using a subset of that column.

rbTbl$Hand[is.na(rbTbl$NUM)] <- rbTbl$WHOLE[is.na(rbTbl$NUM)]

# Now we're going to reverse what we've just done above by going to the
# instances where NUM IS NOT NA - remember that ! is the same thing as IS NOT.
# So each of the columns is subset to be only instances where NUM is not NA, and
# then we do a simple calculation to turn those component columns into a decimal
# representation of hand size. If you don't subset each of the values you're
# trying to use in your calculation then you'll run into an error because you'll
# be trying to add vectors of different lengths.

rbTbl$Hand[!is.na(rbTbl$NUM)] <- rbTbl$WHOLE[!is.na(rbTbl$NUM)] + (rbTbl$NUM[!is.na(rbTbl$NUM)]/rbTbl$DENOM[!is.na(rbTbl$NUM)])

# We can then re-use those columns we just created and go through the same
# exercise to convert Arm into a decimal.

rbTbl$WHOLE <- as.numeric(str_extract(rbTbl$Arm,"[0-9]+"))

rbTbl$NUM <- as.numeric(str_extract(rbTbl$Arm," [0-9]"))

rbTbl$DENOM <- as.numeric(str_extract(rbTbl$Arm,"[0-9]$"))

rbTbl$Arm[is.na(rbTbl$NUM)] <- rbTbl$WHOLE[is.na(rbTbl$NUM)]

rbTbl$Arm[!is.na(rbTbl$NUM)] <- rbTbl$WHOLE[!is.na(rbTbl$NUM)] + (rbTbl$NUM[!is.na(rbTbl$NUM)]/rbTbl$DENOM[!is.na(rbTbl$NUM)])

# Now we might want to calculate some speed scores. First we need to make sure
# that the forty yard dash column is named such that it will be easy to refer
# back to it. The colnames function should be familiar by now. Note that we
# could have named all columns before we started, and when you know exactly what
# you want to do that's easiest. I'm more making this up as I go.

colnames(rbTbl)[7] <- "FORTY.FIRST"

# Then we just make sure it's in numeric format. Again, if you know which
# columns you'll be working with ahead of time the easiest thing to do is to
# convert all of them to numeric in a sapply call at once.

rbTbl$FORTY.FIRST <- as.numeric(rbTbl$FORTY.FIRST)

# This is the formula for speed score.

rbTbl$SPEED <- round(rbTbl$Weight*200 / (rbTbl$FORTY.FIRST^4),0)

# If I wanted just a table of weight, forty and speed score I can subset the
# columns using a named list. The column names need to be quoted.

ssTbl <- rbTbl[,c("Name","Weight","FORTY.FIRST","SPEED")]
