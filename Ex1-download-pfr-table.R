# We'll use two simple packages for this short exercise. You can install them by running the 
# two lines of code below. After you've installed them you don't need to install them again, 
# you can simply load them later. A package/library is just a set of functions that extend R's 
# base code.

install.packages("XML")
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Start by loading the necessary R packages/libraries. You'll need to load the requisite 
# packages each time you want to use the functions contained in a package. 

library("XML")
library("ggplot2")

# Next run this readHTMLTable function which will take a URL along with a few other parameters, 
# go to the web page, and download the table as specified by the 'which' parameter. If you 
# changed 'which' to 3 it would grab a different table in the page. In this case I'm passing it 
# a URL which grabs players from 2015 that saw at least 50 targets and fewer than 20 rushing 
# attempts. I like to use usage proxies instead of specifying position because PFR sometimes 
# miscodes positions. Run the line of code and then it will create an object that you'll be 
# able to click and inspect in the Environment on the right. It should say something like 108 
# obs of 22 variables when you're done.


pfrTbl <- readHTMLTable("http://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&year_min=2015&year_max=2015&season_start=1&season_end=-1&age_min=0&age_max=99&league_id=&team_id=&is_active=&is_hof=&pos_is_qb=Y&pos_is_rb=Y&pos_is_wr=Y&pos_is_te=Y&pos_is_e=Y&pos_is_t=Y&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_ol=Y&pos_is_dt=Y&pos_is_de=Y&pos_is_dl=Y&pos_is_ilb=Y&pos_is_olb=Y&pos_is_lb=Y&pos_is_cb=Y&pos_is_s=Y&pos_is_db=Y&pos_is_k=Y&pos_is_p=Y&c1stat=targets&c1comp=gt&c1val=50&c2stat=rush_att&c2comp=lt&c2val=20&c3stat=&c3comp=gt&c3val=&c4stat=&c4comp=gt&c4val=&c5comp=&c5gtlt=lt&c6mult=1.0&c6comp=&order_by=targets&draft=0&draft_year_min=1936&draft_year_max=2015&type=&draft_round_min=0&draft_round_max=99&draft_slot_min=1&draft_slot_max=500&draft_pick_in_round=0&draft_league_id=&draft_team_id=&college_id=all&conference=any&draft_pos_is_qb=Y&draft_pos_is_rb=Y&draft_pos_is_wr=Y&draft_pos_is_te=Y&draft_pos_is_e=Y&draft_pos_is_t=Y&draft_pos_is_g=Y&draft_pos_is_c=Y&draft_pos_is_ol=Y&draft_pos_is_dt=Y&draft_pos_is_de=Y&draft_pos_is_dl=Y&draft_pos_is_ilb=Y&draft_pos_is_olb=Y&draft_pos_is_lb=Y&draft_pos_is_cb=Y&draft_pos_is_s=Y&draft_pos_is_db=Y&draft_pos_is_k=Y&draft_pos_is_p=Y",which=4,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Now that we've pulled the table in we need to replace some of the column names. Note that 
# the 2nd column is blank so let's give it a name. We use the function colnames() and then 
# specify a column index number - 2, or the 2nd column - and then tell it what name to give 
# that column.

colnames(pfrTbl)[2] <- "Player"

# There are still a few columns that are problematic. For instance, rushing yards and receiving 
# yards aren't differentiated. So we need to fix that. We could keep running the function above 
# over individual columns, but there's an easier way to do that. Instead of specifying a single 
# column to run the function on, we can pass a list or vector of columns to run the function on. 
# Placing items inside c() creates a vector or a list.

colnames(pfrTbl)[c(11,13)] <- c("RuYds","RuTD")

# Next we need to fix some of the data types in the data. When it comes into R from PFR, R 
# doesn't know whether you want to it be a string, or a factor, or a numeric data type. So 
# we have to tell it to cast the data as a type numeric. In the line below we're telling it 
# to run the function as.numeric() on the Year columnd of the pfrTbl and then to take the 
# results of that function and replace the pfrTbl$Year column

pfrTbl$Year <- as.numeric(pfrTbl$Year)

# Again, there are other columns where fixing the data type is necessary. But instead of 
# running that line of code on over 10 columns, we can again pass R a list of columns that 
# we want to alter. In this case we're using the sapply function to tell R to run the function 
# as.numeric on columns 4, and then 8 through 22 of the pfrTbl. sapply is a poweful function 
# that I use a lot when cleaning up wide tables. After you run this function you'll notice that 
# some NA values are created when R tries to convert a character into a number but the character 
# isn't actually a number.

pfrTbl[c(4,8:22)] <- sapply(pfrTbl[c(4,8:22)],as.numeric)

# When the table came over from PFR it had some column headers midway through the table. Now 
# that the values in those columns have been converted to numbers and have thrown NA values, 
# it makes for an easy way to remove those bad rows. The call below is an example of using the 
# idex properties of an R data.frame. Every row and column in an R data.frame can be referenced 
# in the following way - dataFrame[row,column] - so the call below is specifying the pfrTbl rows 
# where the Year column is not (!) NA. ! generally means IS NOT.

pfrTbl <- pfrTbl[!is.na(pfrTbl$Year),]

# Now that we have the data in numeric format and we've removed some bad rows we can run 
# some calculations on the data. This line of code calculates PPR fantasy points just by 
# referring to the data.frame name, and the column in the data.frame

pfrTbl$FP <- pfrTbl$Rec + pfrTbl$Yds/10 + pfrTbl$TD*6

# Now that we have calculated fantasy points let's plot targets vs. fantasy points. We'll use 
# the ggplot library to do this. This line of code says create a ggplot object where the data 
# comes from pfrTbl and then the aesthetics, or aes(), will be Tgt on the x axis and FP on the 
# y axis. Then we tell it to make a plot layer with that data using the geom_point() function. 

ggplot(data=pfrTbl,aes(Tgt,FP)) + geom_point()

# We can add a smoothed trendline to the plot by just adding the function geom_smooth() to 
# that line of code

ggplot(pfrTbl,aes(Tgt,FP)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

# ggplot defaults to use loess smoothing but you can specify other methods for your trendline. 
# Here's a trendline using a linear model.

ggplot(pfrTbl,aes(Tgt,FP)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")

# We can also create a separate linear model object by using the function lm() and then 
# passing it a formula to use for the model. In this case we'll use FP as the dependent variable 
# and Tgt as the independent variable. Formulas look like this: Dependent Variable ~ Independent 
# Variable 1 + Independent Variable 2 ........ since you can do multiple regression in this 
# same function you can specify more than one independent variable if you want.

mdl <- lm(FP ~ Tgt,pfrTbl)

# The above line of code creates the object for the linear model. But if we want to inspect 
# the model the easiest way to do it is to just run the summary function on the model. That 
# will spit out the model results into the Console below.

summary(mdl)

# When the model object is created it has a number of features that you can access by attaching 
# the $ operator to the reference to the object. Below I'm saying that I want to take the 
# r.squared of the model summary, and then assign it to a new value that I'm creating called 
# rsq

rsq <- summary(mdl)$r.squared

# The rsq value would be easier to read if we round it to the hundredths place. We'll just use 
# the round function for that. If you use Excel the round function will probably make sense.

rsq <- round(rsq,2)

# I want to print the rsq on the actual plot and I want it to be clear what the number means. 
# So I'm going to convert it to a character and paste 'r^2' in front of the actual value. paste() is a pretty useful function for working with text because you can use it to do things like append a player's team to the player's name.

rsq <- paste("r^2 =",rsq)

# Now let's run our ggplot line again, but now we'll tell it to create a text layer that's 
# labeled with the rsq value we've created.

ggplot(pfrTbl,aes(Tgt,FP)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm") + geom_text(x=100,y=350,label=rsq)
